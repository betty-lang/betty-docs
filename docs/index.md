## Getting Started

!!!note
    No binaries are currently supplied for the Betty interpreter. In the future, a GitHub Actions automated workflow for release builds is likely to be set up.

Currently, the fastest way to get started with development in Betty is to clone the repo and build the binaries yourself.

```
git clone https://github.com/betty-lang/betty.git
```
